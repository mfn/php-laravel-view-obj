# Documentation

This package leverages an objects class hierarchy to turn it into a path for a
view template, i.e. if you want to "view" an object of type `App\Article`, the
provided helper `view_obj()` will try to render the view
`_view_obj.App.Article.default` which usually maps to your path
`<PROJECT_ROOT>/resources/views/_view_obj/App/Article/default.php`
(or `default.blade.php`). The object itself will be passed to that view as `$obj`.

Conceptually you can think of it as a partial, where the name of the view is
derived from the objects class hierarchy. Views itself can be hierarchically
organized by virtue of the filesystem, so can classes. This package re-uses that
information for views.

The idea is that an object has different representations, depending on the
context. By default the context is "default" (...), but if you want to render
`$article` as part of a list, you create an appropriate list template and call
the helper with `@view_obj($article, 'list')`. So, ideally, all variants how
`App/Article` is going to be represented in the system are in this one
directory, `_view_obj/App/Article/`. 

The signature of the helper is:

`view_obj(object $object, string $template = 'default', array $data = []): View`

- `object $object`<br>Any object you want to render. Can be a Model or just
  about anything, as long as you created a view template for it in the
  appropriate location

- `string $template`<br>The actual view of that object. The concept is that
  depending on the context you want to render the object, you may want to use
  a different view.

- `array $data`<br>Any data you want to pass in addition to the template.
  Except the note below, the view will only receive explicitly passed variables.
  Note: the object itself is always available as `$obj`.

- returns a `View` object.

For Blade, the directive `@view_obj` is provided with the same signature but
it will already `echo` the returned `View`, whereas in pure PHP code you receive
a `View` object and need act on it yourself (e.g. `echo ...` or `->__toString()`).

For convenience sake, the helper just accepts `(object $object, array $data)`,
i.e. you can omit the `$template` for the default case.

## Examples

In the most simple case, show the default view of the object. Assuming the class
`App\Article`, we first create the default template in
`resources/views/_view_obj/App/Article/default.blade.php`:

- `resources/views/` is the default location for Laravel applications
- `_view_obj/` is the (default) configured "prefix" for all view templates
  derived from objects
- `App/Article/` reflects the class hierarchy
- `default` is the "default" when showing an object without specifying it's
  template.
- `.blade.php` is just the default Laravel extensin for Blade; could be `.php`
  for pure PHP templates.

Example of such a view:

*Note: the object we render always gets passed as `$obj`*
```HTML
<article>
<h1>{{ $obj->title }}</h1>
<div>
{{ $obj->content }}
</div>
</article>
```

Anywhere in a view where you pass on the article, you can invoke the view with:
```PHP
@view_obj($article)
```

We now assume you want to render the article as part of a list, i.e. you have an
array of articles. We first create a `list` template for the article in
`resources/views/_view_obj/App/Article/list.blade.php`. We usually only display
the link/title in the list:

```HTML
<li>
  <a href="{{ URL::route('article', [$obj->id]) }}">
    {{ $obj->title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

Now using the `list` view:

```HTML
@foreach ($articles as $article)
    @view_obj($article, 'list');
@endforeach
```

# Configuration

- `base_path`: Defaults to `_view_obj.` and specifies the prefix for all object
  template specific views. If you don't want this separation, just set it to an
  empty string.
